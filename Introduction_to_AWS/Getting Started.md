## What is Client-Server Model?

- The Client-Server model is about a client that interacts and makes requests to a computer server.

- A `client` can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.
- A `server` can be a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.
  - For example, suppose that a client requests a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- You pay only for what you use.

## Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid.

### Cloud-based Deployment

- Everything runs in the cloud.
- This model allows you to build new applications or move existing ones to the cloud.
- There are different levels of services ranging from low to high.
- The level of service has different requirements for your management, architecting, and infrastructure.

For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.

### On-premises Deployment ( also known as private cloud deployment )

- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its application management and virtualization technologies make it more effective.

For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center.

### Hybrid Deployment

- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on the premises.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Payment model

  - The cloud payment model is flexible.
  - You do not have to invest in a data center, servers, and other resources.
  - Cloud services are a variable expense.
  - You can use the services from the start and consume more as you grow.

- Fewer operations

  - Having your own data centers and servers requires resources and staffing.
  - Cloud computing reduces operation and lets you focus on important things, such as your applications and customers.

- Flexible capacity

  - Having and managing your own servers can result in unused capacity and limitations.
  - On the other hand, you can grow freely with cloud computing.
  - You pay for what you use.

- Economies at scale

  - Cloud computing is about shared resources.
  - Sharing the infrastructure cost with hundreds of thousands of other customers lowers the overall costs.

- Increase speed and agility

  - The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier to develop and deploy applications.
  - You can test and utilize resources as you want in minutes.
  - This freedom allows you to experiment and invent more.
  - It allows for instant resource access.

- Go global in minutes
  - AWS has data centers all over the world.
  - The AWS Cloud's global reach allows you to swiftly deploy apps to consumers anywhere.
  - Customers can access your apps quickly.
  - You can pick the ones near your clients to reduce the latency.
